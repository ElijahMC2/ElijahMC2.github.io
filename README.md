**PROJECT 1**

Table 1 (shown in file) displays a cross-classification of a sample of infants. Investigate whether or not a mother’s age
and smoking puts a new-born baby at risk. You may use any methods you deem appropriate including
methods not covered in 220A to address the following specific questions.

(a) Are young mothers or older mothers more likely to smoke?

(b) Are smokers more likely to have premature babies? Are older mothers more likely to have premature babies?

(c) Are smokers more likely to have babies who died in the 1st year? Are older mothers more likely
to have babies who died in the 1st year?

(d) How do age and smoking habits affect survival? How does age and smoking habits affect gestational
age?

(e) How do age and smoking habits affect survival among premature babies?

(f) How do smoking habits affect survival among premature babies with young mothers? How do
smoking habits affect survival among premature babies with older mothers?

Write a report (no more than 4 pages) to a physician describing your analysis methods, conclusions,
and any limitations of these. When writing your report, assume that this physician only has very
introductory statistical training.


**PROJECT 2**

In a good data analysis, one usually needs to go through several exploratory “iterations” before
reaching at the final results. In the process, tentative models should be evaluated and reevaluated by
both statistical analytical tools and by common sense. In the presentation of the final results, however,
one should avoid tedious reporting, but instead focus on the important findings. When appropriate, do
use plots in your exploration, and do include good ones in your presentation.

The data set property.txt in the same folder contains a random sample of 83 properties for sale in a
city. It contains 5 variables:
1. size: size of the property (in square meters).
2. age: age of the property (in years).
3. dc: distance (in km) from the property to the city center.
4. dt: distance (in km) from the property to a toxic waste disposal site.
5. price: the listed price of the property, in thousands of dollars.

Investigate how listed price depends on other variables.
