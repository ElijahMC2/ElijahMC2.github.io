1. An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of an educational program on compliance
with glove use in a cardiology department of a hospital. The participants in the study were all 23
members of the department’s nursing staff. They all attended an educational program addressing
the importance of wearing gloves. Without their knowledge, the nurses were observed during heart
valve surgeries before and one, two, and five months after an educational program to see how often
they wore gloves. Each procedure by a nurse was counted as a separate observation.

The dataset glove.dat contains the following variables:

**Period** Observation period (1 = before intervention, 2 = one month after intervention, 3 = two
months after, 4 = 5 months after intervention)

**Observed** Number of times the nurse was observed

**Gloves** Number of times the nurse used gloves

**Experience** Years of experience of nurse

Investigate whether the educational program on the importance of using gloves improve glove use
in heart valve surgeries and whether it depends on the years of experience.

2. A school district is concerned with school attendance. They randomly selected 316 6th graders
from two elementary schools in the district and collected their school attendance, standardized
test scores and gender. The dataset school.txt includes the following variables:

**school** an indicator of two schools.

**gender** Male (“M”) or Female (“F”).

**math** standardized math test score.

**language** standardized language test score.

**absence** number of days of absence.

The goal is to study the attendance behavior. Specifically, investigate how the number of days of
absence depends on other variables.
