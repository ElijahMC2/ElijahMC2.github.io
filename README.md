In a study to investigate survival of the Atlantic halibut, survival time and other variables were
recorded for 294 halibut. Some fish were removed from the experiment before they die because of
limited holding facility. Therefore some observations of survival time were censored. The dataset is
available on Canvas.

The data set contains the following variables:

No - observation number (1,...,294).

TIME - survival time of halibut (time until death) in hours.

CENSOR - censoring indicator. 1=uncensored observation; 0=censored observation.

TOWD - duration (in minutes) of time trawl net was towed on the bottom.

DELDEPTH - difference between maximum and minimum depth observed during tow (depth measured in meters).

LENGTH - fork length of halibut in centimeters.

HANDTIME - handling time (in minutes) between net coming on board vessel and fish being placed
in holding tanks.

LOGCAT - natural logarithm of total catch of fish in tow.

Answer the following two questions:

1. What is the difference, if any, between the survival rates for the two tow durations?
2. How other covariates affect the survival rate of Atlantic halibut?
