# PSTAT 232 Final Project 

You decide the project: it could be a reproduction of a research paper, or an extension of a statistical method. But it should be something interesting/useful about **computational techniques in statistics**. You are encouraged to work on a project about computational methods that is directly related to your own research! Each group will submit one report (no page limit). Please note that:

Your project does not need to be completely novel, but should not just duplicate previous work done by others

An typical example of project development cycle involves:

1. Pick a research paper in statistical computing that interests you

2. Understand the problem (or the family of problems) this paper is studying

3. Replicate the results in a paper

4. Summarize your understandings of the paper

5. Try using the technique on another application and or provide computation / theoretical analysis of components of the paper
